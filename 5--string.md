String literal is a special data type,it can be announced by double quotation marks.In the other way,character literal is announced by single quotation markã€‚

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(){
  char arr1[] = "abc";//string literal has a hidden null character '\0',it is used to mark the end of the string
  char arr2[] = {'a','b','c'};
  printf("%s\n",arr1);//abc
  printf("%s\n",arr2);//abc etc.
  printf("%d\n",strlen(arr1));//strlen is a function to carculate the string's length//3
  printf("%d\n",strlen(arr2));//a random number
  return 0;
}
