If you define a data and its value,it may be a constant or variable.
Constant cannot be changed later,like gender,blood type and so on.
In the other way,variable can be changed instantly,like second,weight.

#include <stdio.h>
int a = 100;//this is a global variable
int main(){
  int a = 10;//int is used to define the variable's data type //this is a local variable
  int b = 0;
  int sum = 0;
  printf("输入一个数字");
  scanf("%d",&b);//scanf is a function to acquire user's input //& is used to obtain the Address-of Operator
  sum = a+b;
  printf("%d",sum);
  return 0;
}

If global variable and local variable have same name,when in a function,it will use the local variable instead of global variable.And it will use the global variable if in the outside.
